NAME
----
golpy - A Conway's Game of Life Simulator written in Python

SYNOPSIS
--------
*golpy* [*-h* | *--help*] [*--no-gpu*] [*--n*] [*--m*]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*golpy* is an awesome Conway's Game of Life simulator written in Python.
It uses key binding combinations similar to vim key binding. It can 
improve performance using GPU support. For this you need to install 
pycuda library. With GPU support the grid must be bounded (default is 
500x500).

OPTIONS
-------
*--no-gpu*::
    Disable GPU support.
*--n*::
    Number of rows of the grid.
*--m*::
    Number of columns of the grid.

KEY BINDINGS
------------
Navigation
~~~~~~~~~~
The navigation is vim-like [ *cntrl+* ] 'hjkl'.
Zoom
~~~~
Use the keys '+'(zoom-in) ans '-'(zoom-out).
Status 
~~~~~~
Press 'v' to see the status of the simulator. Press 'd' or 'u' to respectively
slow down or speed up the simulator.

MOUSE BINDINGS
--------------
Painting
~~~~~~~~
Click with left button mouse to paint. If the cell is already painted to alive,
it will be switched to death.

Applying Patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Click right button mouse and select one of the pattern that appears into the menu.
Once selected put it into the grid with left button or click the right button to apply transformations such as rotation, flip horizontally, flip vertically to the pattern.

Zoom
~~~~
Press *cntrl* button and then select an area of the grid to zoom-in.
